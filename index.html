                    <p>Welcome to my Portfolio!</p>
                    <p>I'm Mary Wairimu, a passionate Geoinformatics student at Technical University of Kenya, currently in my fourth year pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Geoinformatics.</p>
                    <p>I'm driven by the power of GIS to transform raw spatial data into meaningful insights that can drive policy decisions, urban planning, environmental conservation, and disaster management. My journey in tech was further enhanced when I joined the Power Learn Project Software Development Scholarship Program, which helped me bridge GIS with modern software development.</p>
                    <p>During my leisure time, you can find me exploring new GIS software, crocheting, gaming (especially Call of Duty), discovering new restaurants, attending concerts or travelling.</p>

                    <p>Learning journey in TUK</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Program Focus:</strong> The curriculum imparts both theoretical and practical knowledge in:</p>
                    <ol class="course-highlights">
                        <li>Spatial data acquisition, processing, management, and information extraction</li>
                        <li>Problem analysis and structuring for designing effective solutions using remote sensing and GIS</li>
                        <li>Database technology and spatial/temporal modeling</li>
                        <li>Software development principles for geospatial applications</li>
                        <li>Governance applications including policy development and decision-making</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Through Internal Based Learning (IBL), I gained practical experience using surveying instruments, drones, and real-life examples in ArcMap 10.5 and QGIS. Notable projects include assessing flood fatalities that occurred during heavy rains last year, applying GIS techniques to analyze risk patterns and create mitigation recommendations.</p>
